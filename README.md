# FitConnect
Project summary:
In fitness or any industry, it is generally easier for people to gather information or do services due to the use of the web. So, in this project, we built a fitness and workout programming platform where we specialized this platform for the whole purpose of serving gym owners to get customers and for providing online coach freelancers with services.
 Design Goals:
Goal 1:  System Registration for Fitness coaches, Gym owners and Clients
Goal 2: For clients: show specific types of body goals and their weight, size, and daily calorie intake and burn. After that, their interface will have a simple tutorial-based video, a seeking coach option, and a find a gym nearby system. 
Goal 3: Fitness coaches, will have their user interface with a video posting for exercise videos as well as adding the option to aid in requesting messages from clients.

Goal 4: This one is optional but for clients who are also a gym member, we also aim to provide gym owners with a way to find more gym clients nearby and for clients to help find the closest gym. This is also useful for direct coaching other than online coaching in which we aim for a better and smoother experience for both the customer and coach.
 Goal 5: We also want to provide a payment system for clients, freelancer coaches, and gym owners. Clients either have a direct yearly/monthly plan system or pay by service system. Similarly, Freelancers and gym owners will pay us through a monthly payment, although for freelancers, all the client money offered for the service will be respectfully lent to them.
Goal 6: We will take additional feedback/reviews from customers like surveys or quizzes to get the consumer more motivated. From those data that we gather, we can get a deeper connection and a more personalized experience for the clients and also raise competitive advantages. We will also have a feedback loop to gather feedback from clients and coaches to refine the quiz and matching system over time.

Goal 7: make a calories/protein tracker as well as a daily progress/habit tracker and meal diet tip like cooking for recommended meal tutorial ( optional: for easier purpose, send link on youtube instead of hiring a meal guide )
